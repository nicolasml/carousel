		  <div class="panel">
		    <p>Confessional with punchlines – that’s how Amy Winehouse described her songwriting, providing the key to Asif Kapadia’s sober, unsensational and overwhelmingly sad film about her short and volatile life. In the absence of narration, Winehouse’s lyrics tell the story, floating onscreen in a handwritten font that creates the illusion of a coherent diary, from childhood to stardom.</p>
